* Optical. Have a camera pointed at the stack and have a very simple to
  read QR code or even just basic line pattern on the sides of the blocks
  Use retro reflective stickers and print QR or bar codes on to them. Use
  Infrared light to brighten it for the camera without effecting the user.
* NFC (near field communication). I don't think these can chain
* RFID, also can't chain?
* Just wires... I don't think this is possible.
* A chip on every block. Expensive, work to construct them, clearly works.
* 3D printed clocks with conductive and not conductive plastic
