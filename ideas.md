Have a light sequence that is clearly not part of the lights when
programmed. For example a flashing slow pulsing white to black. Or even
just some neutral muted color that's not in the RBG CMY space provided.

Have a mode where the lights will auto reset when the board hits a fixed
point of the on tick. This will allow the game of life to reboot once it
hits a stuck state. But it might be best for that to be optional because
people might want to see the stuck state and not advance to a reset.
